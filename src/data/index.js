        content: [`The International Mining and Ventilation Science Society (IMVSS) is a leading global professional organisation committed to advancing the science, technology, and best practices related to mine ventilation and the broader field of mining environmental control. Originally established through the founding of the International Mine Ventilation Congress (IMVC) in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1975, the Society has grown into a vital international forum for knowledge exchange, innovation, and collaboration across the mining industry.
  
  Over the past four decades, IMVSS has brought together ventilation engineers, mining professionals, researchers, manufacturers, policymakers, and academic institutions from all continents. Through its internationally hosted congresses—held every four years—the Society has continually addressed emerging challenges and cutting-edge developments in underground ventilation, mine refrigeration and cooling, occupational health and safety, gas management, and environmental sustainability.`]
